# dnn_activation
We investigate the relation between DNN (Deep Neural Network) approximation and activation function selection. This repo is a supplementary material for the [author's blog post](link). 

### Purpose
DNN approximation is heavily dependent on their architecture, especially activation functions. This repo's codes learn to approximates the following functions
